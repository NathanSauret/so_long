# So_long
So_long is a project at 42Paris, my version is inspired by the video game Patapon on PSP, all the sprites and textures were drawn by hand.  
There are animated sprites and ennemies that can be backstabbed, but watch out, if you touch the enemies from the front of the side: Game Over.  
The walls are pretty with a system that round corners and extremities.  
The goal is to collect all the coins.

here is an exemple of the result:
